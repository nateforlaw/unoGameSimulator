# Uno!

**This game does**  ***not***  **follow official uno rules.**

You can play it [here](https://nlawrence162.github.io/unoGameSimulator/). (Recommended platform: PC, Chrome Browser)  
This program was created by an IT intern(me) in order to show off what I currently know about the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework.
